SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that secure communication between a client and server by encrypting data in transit. TLS is the modern, more secure version of SSL and has replaced it in most applications. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because it uses SSL/TLS to protect data from eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Without SSL/TLS, sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information can be intercepted or altered. Real-world incidents, such as the 2014 “FREAK” vulnerability and various cases of websites transmitting credentials in plaintext, have shown that missing or misconfigured SSL can lead to data breaches and compromised accounts. Using properly configured SSL/TLS is now considered a basic requirement for web security.
